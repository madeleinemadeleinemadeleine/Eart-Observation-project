# A study of the stress response of vegetation to drought situation through multispectral satellite imagery. Case of study of Como lake, summer 2022.

In the summer of 2022, the subalpine Italian forests
suffered from high drought conditions. The scope of
the analysis is to compare multispectral response of
vegetation data between 2022 and 2021 (this former
as model year) using multi-spectral indexes. NDVI
will be computed and compared between the 2 years.
Usually higher NDVI values are associated to healthier vegetation, but contradicting results will lead to
the validation of a second hypothesis, that plants can
react to a drought event by increasing their chlorophyll content.
